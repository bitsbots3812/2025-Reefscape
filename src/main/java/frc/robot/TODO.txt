Create Subsystems:
 - Coral Manipulator: âœ”
  - Tilt control âœ”
  - Intake wheelsâœ”
   - Allow Individual Control of each side to permit spinning the coral when
     dropping into trough.âœ”
  - Color Sensor âœ”
  - Tilt Limits âœ”
  - Stall DetectionðŸ”„(ON HOLD)
  - Hardware:

    - 2 Intake Wheel Motors
    - 1 Tilt Motors
   - REV Through bore encoder
    - Absolute mode (use DutyCycleEncoder)
   - REV Color Sensor

 - Algae Manipulator:
  - Tilt control - Independent PID on each side (no arm control class)âœ”
  - Intake wheels controlâœ”
  - Proximity Sensorâœ”
  - Hardware:
   - VictorSPX x 3
    - Intake Motor
    - Tilt Motors x 2
   - Analog Encoders (left and right)
   - IR Proximity Sensor
    - Same as on summer bot

- Vision:
 - Provide information for drivetrain to steer toward a target (apiltag or game piece)
 - Hardware:
  - Photonvision SBC
  - Webcams

- LED Control:
 - Put data on networktables to control DS LEDs
